 Handling CORS Issues
 
If you encounter any issues fetching data from the API due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions, you can use a browser extension to bypass these restrictions.

Install a CORS extension:

For Chrome: Install the CORS Unblock extension.
For Firefox: Install the CORS Everywhere extension.
Enable the extension: Once installed, enable the extension in your browser. This will allow your application to bypass CORS restrictions when fetching data from the API.

Refresh the application: After enabling the CORS extension, refresh your browser to ensure that data is fetched correctly.
